mountains like the andes, eroded by glaciers and extension (faults from zealandia continent separation lets it fall)

majority of mountains is in giant root, extending into crust

glaciers carve out valleys

water cuts v shaped valleys

ice cuts wider deep u shaped valleys

flow direction is based on 'land' angle, not the mountain angle

correct way to draw - elevated, then 'u shapes cut in in angle of land

mountain range (linear on both sides), with vectors, which reduce depth based on nearest point to the vector


1. mountain range (base elevation)

2. fixed interval vectors (parallel to ranges)
3. find closest vector
4 based on dist, reduce elevation
